## Overview

The Budget Tracker is a web application designed to help users manage their project budgets and track expenses. It allows users to create projects, categorize expenses, and see how much budget is left for each project.

## Features

- **Project Management**: Create, view, and manage projects.
- **Expense Tracking**: Add and categorize expenses for each project.
- **Budget Management**: Track the remaining budget after each expense.
- **Category Management**: Assign categories to expenses.
- **Delete Expenses**: Remove expenses through an AJAX-based DELETE request.
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-friendly interface built with Materialize CSS framework.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Python web framework for the backend.
- **Materialize CSS**: Front-end CSS framework for a modern, responsive layout.
- **JavaScript/jQuery**: For AJAX functionality to handle asynchronous requests.
- **Django ORM**: For managing database models and queries.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL (Database)**: Database backend (assuming the default Django database setup).
- **jQuery UI**: Used for the datepicker feature.
  
## Data Structures

- **Django Models**:
  - `Project`: Represents a project with attributes like `name`, `slug`, and `budget`.
  - `Category`: Represents categories that are used to classify expenses in a project.
  - `Expense`: Represents individual expenses in a project, which are associated with a `Category`.
  
- **Lists and QuerySets**:
  - `expense_list`: A list of `Expense` objects retrieved from the database.
  - `category_list`: A list of `Category` objects associated with a `Project`.

## Algorithms Used

- **Slug Generation**: The `slugify` method is used to generate a URL-safe version of the project name.
- **Budget Calculation**: The `budget_left` property calculates the remaining budget by summing all related expenses.
- **Expense Deletion**: AJAX is used for deleting expenses without reloading the page.
